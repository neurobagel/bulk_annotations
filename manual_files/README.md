The file in this directory is generated by manually annotating
the `outputs/assessments.tsv` file with the Neurobagle annotation
tool: [https://annotate.neurobagel.org/](https://annotate.neurobagel.org/).

If you don't have the `outputs/assessments.tsv` file, you can generate it
by running the following command:

```bash
make outputs/assessments.tsv
```
