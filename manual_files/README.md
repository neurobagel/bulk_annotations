The file in this directory is generated by manually annotating
the `outputs/assessments.tsv` file with the Neurobagel annotation
tool: [https://annotate.neurobagel.org/](https://annotate.neurobagel.org/).

If you don't have the `outputs/assessments.tsv` file, you can generate it
by running the following command:

```bash
make outputs/assessments.tsv
```


# Apply remapping of terms

1. Run `make outputs/assessments.json` and `make outputs/assessments.tsv`
2. Manually annotate the `outputs/assessments.tsv` file with the Neurobagel annotation tool: [https://annotate.neurobagel.org/](https://annotate.neurobagel.org/) and store it under `manual_files/assessments_data_dictionary.json`.
3. Run `make remap_openneuro` to apply the remapping of terms to the annotated open neuro data dictionaries.
4. Check the updated data dictionaries and then push the changes to the openneuro-annotations repo
